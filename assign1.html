    <p><sp>The Battle of Thermopylae (/θərˈmɒpɪliː/ thər-MOP-i-lee; Greek: Μάχη τῶν Θερμοπυλῶν, Máchē tōn Thermopylōn) was
        fought between an alliance of Greek city-states, led by King Leonidas I of Sparta, and the Achaemenid Empire of
        Xerxes I over the course of three days, during the second Persian invasion of Greece.</sp></p>
  
        <p><o>A Greek force of approximately 7,000 men marched north to block the pass in the middle of 480 BC. The Persian
        army, alleged by the ancient sources to have numbered over one million, but today considered to have been much
        smaller (various figures are given by scholars, ranging between about 100,000 and 150,000)[11][12] arrived at
        the pass in late August or early September. The vastly outnumbered Greeks held off the Persians for seven days
        (including three of battle) before the rear-guard was annihilated in one of history's most famous last stands.
        During two full days of battle, the small force led by Leonidas blocked the only road by which the massive
        Persian army could pass. After the second day, a local resident named Ephialtes betrayed the Greeks by revealing
        a small path used by shepherds. It led the Persians behind the Greek lines. Leonidas, aware that his force was
        being outflanked, dismissed the bulk of the Greek army and remained to guard their retreat with 300 Spartans and
        700 Thespians, fighting to the death. Others also reportedly remained, including up to 900 helots and 400
        Thebans; most of these Thebans reportedly surrendered.</o></p>
 
        <p><t>Themistocles was in command of the Greek Navy at Artemisium when he received news that the Persians had taken the
        pass at Thermopylae. Since the Greek strategy required both Thermopylae and Artemisium to be held, given their
        losses, it was decided to withdraw to Salamis. The Persians overran Boeotia and then captured the evacuated
        Athens.</t></p>
